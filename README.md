        Ah ah ah ah
        Ah ah ah ah
        Ah ah ah oh
        Ah ah ah ah
        
        I always knew you were the best
        The coolest girl I know
        So prettier than all the rest
        The star of my show
        So many times I wished you'd be the one for me
        I never knew it'd get like this, girl, what you do to me
        You're who I'm thinking of
        Girl, you ain't my runner-up
        And no matter what you're always number one
        
        My prized possession
        One and only
        Adore ya
        Girl, I want ya
        The one I can't live without, that's you, that's you
        
        You're my special
        Little lady
        The one that makes me crazy
        Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you
        My favorite, my favorite, my favorite
        My favorite girl, my favorite girl
        
        You're used to going out your way to impress these Mr. Wrongs
        But you can be yourself for me, I'll take you as you are
        I know they said, "Believe in love, " is a dream that can't be real
        So, girl, let's write a fairy tale
        And show 'em how we feel
        
        You're who I'm thinking of
        Girl, you ain't my runner-up
        And no matter what you're always number one
        
        My prized possession
        One and only
        Adore ya
        Girl, I want ya
        The one I can't live without, that's you, that's you
        
        You're my special little lady
        The one that makes me crazy
        Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you
        My favorite, my favorite, my favorite
        My favorite girl, my favorite girl
        
        My favorite, my favorite, my favorite
        My favorite girl, my favorite girl
        
        You take my breath away
        With everything you say
        I just wanna be with you
        My baby, my baby, oh
        
        Promise I'll play no games
        Treat you no other way than you deserve
       'Cause you're the girl of my dreams
        
        My prized possession
        One and only
        Adore ya
        Girl, I want ya
        The one I can't live without that's you, that's you
        
        You're my special little lady
        The one that makes me crazy
        Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you
        
        I want you
        (The one I can't live without, that's you), that's you, (that's you),    
        that's you
        (You're my special little lady) You're my special little lady
        (The one that makes me crazy) The one that makes me crazy
        (Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you) You're my   
        favorite girl
        (My favorite, my favorite, my favorite) My favorite girl
        (My favorite girl, my favorite girl) My favorite girl
        (My favorite, my favorite, my favorite) My favorite girl
        (My favorite girl, my favorite girl) My favorite girl
